# WoWScrnShot Renamer (World of Warcraft Screenshot Renamer)
 World of Warcraft uses a Month-Day-Year format for older screenshots, which does not sort properly when sorting by name.  
 This can be particularly problematic when the modification or creation date is altered, such as when files are copied. 
 
 This program renames screenshots to the ISO 8601 format, allowing for proper chronological sorting when sorted by name.

 ## Usage
  You can launch and use the program from anywhere on your system as long as you provide the full path to your screenshot directory.
  
  Alternatively, you can place the executable inside the screenshot directory, and it will automatically detect the working directory.

 ## Notice
 While this program should not cause data loss, it is still possible in rare conditions.
 
 **To prevent any issues, it is recommended to back up your files before renaming them**.
 
 You can use tools such as zip (Windows), 7-Zip, or tar (for Unix-based system) to create an archive of your screenshots.
